I built and programmed a robotic arm. The structure is made of Legos, and it moves with servos connected to an Arduino Uno.
It is controlled via bluetooth from an Android smartphone, but the app - wich is essentially a remote control - is currently
under development. I expect to release it in September 2016.

There are 4 servos, including one for the claw. I won't release a detailed plan of the structure because you probably don't 
have the same Lego bricks, but a global schematic of the structure is available (schematic_structure.png*) same as one for the
Arduino and servos connections (schematic_circuit.fzz).

I'm a beginner and this is by first real project. I've been tinkering with Arduino, LEDs, LCDs, capacitors, sensors, etc, so I
acquired knowledge in electronics and programming, but I am currently learning Java and Android development in order to be able
to create the app, because know absolutely nothing about it...

I love open-source because I can share my projects, for everybody to learn, and on the other hand, people can help me when I'm 
having trouble with a programming issue.
However, I'd like to create the app as much by myself as possible, because I really want to do this project on my own.

Thanks for reading and I hope you will like my project.

*In the schematic of the structure, the claw is oriented vertically, but actually, it is oriented horizontally...
